### Overview
For this project, our group wanted to know the top 5 cities in the US people were moving to and from. We decided to use data from the US Census API to get this information. We also wanted to know some contributing factors. The Census had datasets that reflect average household income and average housing costs over a duration of 2010-2017. In the PowerPoint, we displayed our findings.
